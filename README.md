# COVID-19 SURVEY APP from was created using React Native
# ***Full Stack Completed Project ***

## Introduction:
COVID-19 SURVEY APP is a survey app that can take a survey from a user and gives feedback to the user. This app was created with a simple interface for all kinds of people so that people can easily understand the app and can use it for their initial COVID-19 health knowledge. In this app, there are major four options available Home, Tips, Survey, and Live Stats. In the tips option, users can see some important tips, what to do and what is not during this pandemic situation. In the survey, the options user fetches some questionnaires in the survey option in the app. The questionnaires are symptoms of COVID-19 and Black Fungus. When the user completes questionnaires and fill-up the form the system will feedback to them on the risk of COVID-19 and Black Fungus like high risk, medium risk, no risk, etc. If the risk is high, medium, or low then the system gives the user some additional feedback like provides some instruction. In the Live Stats option, users can know all positive, death, and recovered cases all over the world, users also can find a specified country COVID-19 positive, deaths, and recovered cases number. From this app, users can also learn COVID-19 past and present variants and also learn about Black Fungus. This app also shows the number of infected people in all the countries of the world.
## Objectives:
* For gives people an initial idea of their body in the absence of COVID-19.
* For gives people an initial idea of their body in the absence of Black Fungus.
* To know initial idea during this pandemic situation what to do in this and what is not.
* To know about the variants of concern and variants of interest of COVID-19.
* To know what are the current COVID-19 status of a specified country or World-Wide case.

## Motivation:
Our main motivational came from corona.gov.bd, surokkha.gov.bd and Worldometer websites.
Corona.gov.bd and surokkha.gov.bd is the top website of Bangladesh that provides information on
Covid-19 online. From these two-site people also can know about Bangladeshâ€™s current situation of
COVID-19 and also can know which areas are highly risky of covid-19. People also can know about
their initial health condition using surveys.
But these two sites are not easy to use for everyone. So that we create an app that interfaces much
easier from these two websites and much easier to understand for all level of people and users easily
find all option in one place.

## FRAMEWORKS:
* React native
* Native base

## TECHNOLOGY :
* WebStorm
* Android Studio
* Emulator

## LANGUAGE:
* JAVASCRIPT
* PHP


### To Run the Application Simply Type in your Terminal: `npx react-native start`
The project will run [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
Open  to view it in the browser.

## How to Setup and Run on your Desktop:

#### Setting up the development environment: [Click here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
Once you complete the environment setup for react-native.
Simply Download the source code then extract the file and Open folder in VS Code or any IDE You Used. Install the dependencies in  node_module from package.json by command on your terminal `npm install`
then run `npx react-native start`

## How to setup the backend:
Required tools:
* XAMPP

copy `COVID-19-SURVEY-APP` directory from `root\database` and paste it into `C:\xampp\htdocs`.
Open XAMPP and start MySQL server and go admin then create a new database name `mydb` then open `mydb (1)` from `COVID-19-SURVEY-FROM`
and copy `create table` command and run it. Again copy `INSERT` command and run.

*Last things to do: go to your `commend prompt` type `ipconfig` press `enter` and copy your `IPv4 addresses`. Once you have coped IP addresses you need to go `package.json` file and update the `proxy` only.*

Example: 
#### [ "proxy": "http://192.168.0.101/COVID-19-SURVEY-APP" ]
my id addresses is 192.168.10.33
#### After update IP addresses : [ "proxy": "http://192.168.10.33/COVID-19-SURVEY-APP" ]

###*Now Your Database is Ready.*
Restart XAMPP and start Apache server and MySQL server.
